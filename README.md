#### Checkpoints

I am using the Seattle flyway chart to find those locations that have the little flag pinned to a location.  These are called **"VFR Checkpoints"**.  The underline indicates proper name of the VFR Checkpoint.  Check out the [Areonautical Chart Users' Guide - VFR Charting Products](https://aeronav.faa.gov/user_guide/20220324/cug-visual-edition.pdf) for more information.
